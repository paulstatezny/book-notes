# The Book

*Title:* Rework

*Authors:* Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

## Chapter 2: Takedowns

- "Planning is guessing." don't try to plan far out; just do what makes sense today.
- "Why grow?" People assume rapid growth is a good thing, but is it?
  - They look down on small companies, but what's wrong with small companies?
  - Large companies come with a lot of costs: more money to keep things running, harder to make changes.
- Workaholism shouldn't be regarded as a good thing; it means you're not putting your focus in the right areas.

## Chapter 3: Go

- When building a business, "scratch your own itch". If you're not a member of the same group as your audience/users, it's harder to tell if your product is any good. But if you're building something for _yourself_ (and others), you have the advantage as a product designer of being able to intuit what's right and what's wrong.
- "Start making something": Ideas aren't valuable; execution is.
- "Draw a line in the sand": Take a stand; base your company around a strong opinion you have. Some will hate you for it; many others will love you for it. They'll defend you and become a passionate fanbase.
- "Outside Money is Plan Z": Taking investment money comes with all sorts of downsides.
  - You live in this imaginary world where you forget you need to be profitable.
  - You give up ownership of the company.
  - You lost control / a voice; the board gets a large say in everything.
  - Instead, you can either take a business loan or realize that you actually don't need much to start at all!
  - It makes the business bloated; you don't realize what you don't need!
- "Have less mass", such as:
  - Long-term contracts
  - Meetings
  - Thick process
  - Excess staff
  - Office politics
  - Permanent decisions

## Chapter 4: Progress

- Embrace constraints (money, time, etc) -- they bring out your creativity!
- Build half a product, not a half-assed product. Keep the product as simple as possible; the alternative is usually to make it bloated and not great.
- "Start at the epicenter": Figure out what's core to the business (and therefore what's _not_) and focus almost entirely on that! Or you'll end up with a hot dog stand that has great condiments but a terrible dog.
- "Ignore the details early on": Just ignore them, seriously. Or you'll lose your high-level direction.
- "Decisions are progress": Just make a decision; don't get into analysis paralysis. It'll boost morale, and you can always correct later.
- "Be a curator": Focus on the quality of features, not the number.
- "Throw less at the problem": Be careful of taking a "everything's a nail" approach to problems (if you have a "hammer"); look for ways to remove obstacles or fix problems that take significantly less effort.
- "Focus on what won't change": "Things people will want today and 10 years from now." That should be the core of your business.
- "Gear doesn't matter" / "The tone is in your fingers": Jimmy Hendrix can make a knockoff stratocaster sound great; a beginner can make a $10,000 guitar sound terrible. Don't obsess over the best tools, etc. Focus on _using them well_.
- "Launch now!": Careful not to overestimate where you need to be to launch. Crate and Barrel just put things out on display on the crates and barrels they arrived in.

## Chapter 5: Productivity

- "Get real" / "Illusions of agreement": Be careful with documents and reports that are pie-in-the-sky analysis. Talk about what's real -- things in the real world that aren't abstract -- and your communication will be way more productive.
- Be willing to quit doing something when you realize it's not the right direction (even if you've poured hours into it!)
- Interruption is the enemy of productivity! Protect your employees; give them huge blocks of time with no meetings, etc.
- "Meetings are toxic": They're often hugely time inefficient. Keep them short (use a timer!), invite less people, have a specific objective and focus only on it and _stop_ meeting when you've met it.
- Get sleep! (Without enough sleep, your performance is terrible in multiple ways.)
- Long lists don't get done. (Split them into multiple smaller lists, pare them down.)

## Chapter 6: Competitors

Basically, don't worry about them.

- Don't copy them. You're irrelevant then.
- They might copy you, but you're offering more than a product. You're offering _you_. So don't fret. Pour yourself into your product, and copycats will look like fakes.
- Underdo your comptetition; instead of trying to one-up them, simplify. (E.g. flip camera)

## Chapter 7: Evolution

- "Say no": Build a great product by focusing on what's critical, building only that, and ignoring the rest.
- Don't destroy the elegance/simplicity of your product to please vocal customers.
- Give ideas time to cool off so you can objectively see if they're that great.
- "At home good": Make things that are great to use; not things that look great in marketing. (Don't worry if the marketing will sound sensational!)

## Chapter 8: Promotion

- Be okay with being small and obscure; it makes it easier to experiment without fear of big consequences.
- Build an audience (e.g. with a blog); it's infinitely cheaper to market a product to an audience that's already coming to you! Instead of paying big $$$ on ads.
- Don't outspend competitors; out-teach them. (Teach things for free! See "build an audience")
- "Go behind the scenes": Be super transparent about the inner workings of your business. It fascinates and draws people. (See "build an audience".)
- "Press releases are spam" -- want news coverage? Call a journalist. Get personal.
- "Niche media over mass media" -- your product will get more attention if you market in some niche blog rather than the NYT.
- Give away something free, like drug dealers do. (To hook people.)
- "Marketing is not a department; it's everything you do!" (Every email you write, every phone call, the validation error copy on a web form.)

## Chapter 9: Hiring

- Do it yourself first! It will help you manage better because you understand the job.
  - And maybe it will show, you don't need someone! See chapter 3.
- Be willing to pass on great people if there's no reason to hire.
- Give prospects a real task to do; ignore their résumé, years of experience, and GPA, and focus on their real output.
- Hire people who:
  - Can write well (it's a sign of intelligence! And a necessary skill)
  - Can manage themselves
- Hire remote! Why limit your pool?

## Chapter 10: Own your Business

When you make mistakes, be real about it. Put it out there (loudly!) before anyone else does. People appreciate genuineness and the optics are way better.

Apologize like a human; take full responsibility. None of this, "I'm sorry if _____ hurt you" half apology stuff.

## Chapter 11: Culture

- "Culture is the by-product of consistent behavior"
- "Culture is action, not words"
- These things do not define your culture:
  - Official policy
  - A slogan
  - A mission statement
- "Build a rockstar environment": Instead of trying to hire "rock stars", focus on making an environment where people can thrive. The environment makes a _huge_ difference on a person's work.
- Treat people like adults. Don't babysit them. No "you can't get on Facebook at work"
- Be slow to create official policies just because there's a problem. Issue with someone's dress? Don't jump to a dress code; just talk to them about it.
- "Sound like you": Scrap the stale, boring executive language. Don't paint everything as unconditionally positive.
- Watch out for communicating with extremes/absolutes. Don't say you "need" / "can't" / something's "easy" if it's not really true.
- "ASAP is Poison": Have an objective view of priority, and don't say something's top priority unless it actually is. If everything's priority, nothing is.

## Conclusion

**When you are inspired, act immediately. Even if it means blowing up a weekend. Inspiration has an expiration date.**
