# The House That Cleans Itself

## The HTCI System

1. Become a detective
  - The questions to answer:
    - What are the problem areas in my home?
    - What items do our recurring messes generally consist of?
    - Why do these particular problems and messes keep happening?
  - Go around to every room in your house and make note of all of the mess: what items are there? Where are they? Anything out of order.
    - Climb on a step stool to see things from a fresh perspective.
    - Snap photos for reference. (Another fresh perspective; you'll catch other things.)
  - For each item, analyze and record the reason and the *root cause*.
    - The root cause *cannot* be the person who made the mess. You must find a root cause that's about the *environment*.
2. Change the house to fit the behavior
  - For each mess/item from step 1, come up with a solution that attacks the root cause not by trying to change your behavior directly, but by modifying the environment so it's just as easy to do the "clean" thing.
    - This is going to require creativity!
    - For each item, brainstorm multiple possible solutions.
    - Expect to have to experiment a bit in order to find the best solution.
  - Abstract examples:
    - Find new (more convenient) places where things belong.
    - Place a fitting container near where things normally get "dropped".
  - Concrete examples:
    - Bench that doubles as a chest next to front door for backpacks.
    - Groceries don't get put away always?
        - Problem is exhaustion? Delegate! The one who does the shopping is different from the one who puts the food away. (Notice she's breaking her rule to make your solution about the environment, not the behavior.)
        - Problem is messy pantry? Label it and create separate areas for different foods.
  - Requirements:
    1. The solution has to work *for you* and the way you behave.
    2. You can't just ignore the problem and say, "I just won't let that happen again!"
3. Create a first impression of clean
  - 4 Tips:
    1. Control your sight zones
    2. Corral your necessary messes
    3. Utilize camouflage
    4. Eliminate the inevitable invisibles
4. Think like a hotel
5. Aim for simplicity 
6. Explore the "why"
7. Make it a team effort
8. Put God at the center
