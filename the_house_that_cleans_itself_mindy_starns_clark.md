## The Larger Principle: Applied Common-Sense Psychology

This book contains a paradigm shift for thinking about habit problems.

While Clark's system makes sense for housekeeping, it seems the root principle is to "use common sense psychology to solve organizational problems, instead of blaming the person".

While I'm interested in attempting to apply the method to housekeeping, I'm just as interested in trying to apply this to:

  - Keeping up with email
  - Keeping work/life balance
  - Being productive at work and not getting bogged down by meetings
  - Staying connected with long-distance friends
  - Keeping up with my GTD system
    - Instead of making a daily to do list, use the GTD system as my to do list to force me to keep up with it. ("The most effective to-do lists are living documents.")

It seems that the base HTCI system can be applied in any area like those:

1. Take conscious note of the problem.
2. Analyze it down to a root cause that involves the environment (physical or otherwise) instead of personal discipline.
3. Brainstorm creative solutions, allowing for iteration until an elegant solution reveals itself.

## The HTCI System

1. Become a detective
  - The questions to answer:
    - What are the problem areas in my home?
    - What items do our recurring messes generally consist of?
    - Why do these particular problems and messes keep happening?
  - Go around to every room in your house and make note of all of the mess: what items are there? Where are they? Anything out of order.
    - Climb on a step stool to see things from a fresh perspective.
    - Snap photos for reference. (Another fresh perspective; you'll catch other things.)
  - For each item, analyze and record the reason and the *root cause*.
    - The root cause *cannot* be the person who made the mess. You must find a root cause that's about the *environment*.
2. Change the house to fit the behavior
  - For each mess/item from step 1, come up with a solution that attacks the root cause not by trying to change your behavior directly, but by modifying the environment so it's just as easy to do the "clean" thing.
    - This is going to require creativity!
    - For each item, brainstorm multiple possible solutions.
    - Expect to have to experiment a bit in order to find the best solution.
  - Abstract examples:
    - Find new (more convenient) places where things belong.
    - Place a fitting container near where things normally get "dropped".
  - Concrete examples:
    - Bench that doubles as a chest next to front door for backpacks.
    - Groceries don't get put away always?
        - Problem is exhaustion? Delegate! The one who does the shopping is different from the one who puts the food away. (Notice she's breaking her rule to make your solution about the environment, not the behavior.)
        - Problem is messy pantry? Label it and create separate areas for different foods.
  - Requirements:
    1. The solution has to work *for you* and the way you behave.
    2. You can't just ignore the problem and say, "I just won't let that happen again!"
3. Create a first impression of clean
  - 4 Tips:
    1. Control your sight zones
    2. Corral your necessary messes
    3. Utilize camouflage
    4. Eliminate the inevitable invisibles
4. Think like a hotel
5. Aim for simplicity 
6. Explore the "why"
7. Make it a team effort
8. Put God at the center
