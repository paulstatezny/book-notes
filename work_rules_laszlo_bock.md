- Larry and Sergey both went to Montessori schools. Marissa Mayer said this is key to understanding Google.
- Mervin J. Kelly, president of Bell Labs, is like a spiritual successor to Larry and Sergey; gave tons of freedom and independence to employees and ended up with amazing inventions like the transistor. Engineered interactive office floor plans that encouraged collaboration.
- Kelly thought like a "founder" years before becoming president.

## Chapter 2: Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast

## Chapter 5: Don't Trust Your Gut

- Social sciences reveal that most types interviews tend to be extremely unreliable in determining how a candidate will perform.
- Best predictors of how someone will perform in the actual job:
  1. Work sample tests (29 percent) -- ask them to do a task that's very close to what they'll be doing in the job.
  2. Tests of general cognitive ability (26 percent)
  3. Tests of conscienciousness (10 percent)
  4. Tests of leadership ability (?? percent) -- not "people who champion themselves," but "emergent leadership" where people step in and become leaders when their skills are needed, and then blend back into the team when the time is right.
  5. Structured interviews (ask candidates the exact same questions, so some candidates don't get easier questions or questions that make them look more favorable)
    - Use *Behavioral Questions* ("Tell me about a time when") and *Situational Questions* ("What would you do if")
- Google's approach: combine all the high-signal tools. "Combining behavioral and situational structured interviews with assessments of cognitive ability, conscientiousness, and leadership."
- Why don't more companies do this?
  - It takes a lot of work.
  - But the alternative is an interview process that doesn't effectively identify the best candidates.
