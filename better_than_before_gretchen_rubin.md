# Book Notes: Better Than Before

**Subtitle:** What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits -- To Sleep More, Quit Sugar, Procrastinate Less, and Generally Build a Happier Life

**Author:** Gretchen Rubin

## The Four Tendencies

Centered around whether a person tends to uphold expectations that are **internal** (from oneself) versus **external** (from others).

Most of us fall squarely into one bucket.

1. **Upholder**: Meets inner *and* outer expectations
    - Pro: Very reliable to self, others
    - Con: Often conforms to pointless rules, wasting own time and others' or doing meaningless actions
2. **Questioner**: Resists outer expectations, meets inner expectations
    - Doesn't care about the rules, just what makes sense to them subjectively.
3. **Obliger**: Meets outer expectations, resists inner expectations
    - Really needs to rely on external motivators to solidify a habit. (E.g. Want to read more? Join a book club that has a heavy expectation that everyone will read the material.)
4. **Rebel**: Resists inner *and* outer expectations
    - Basically "what do I feel like doing today"?
    - Helpful to society because they keep its norms in check. (Do these norms make sense?)

## Types of People (Dichotomies)

She basically says you need to engineer habits based on where you fit on a number of different dichotomies.

1. Morning Lark vs Night Owl
2. Marathoner, Sprinter, or Procrastinator
3. Underbuyer vs Overbuyer
4. Simplicity Lover vs Abundance Lover
5. Finisher vs Opener
6. Familiarity Lover vs Novelty Lover
7. Promotion-focused vs Prevention-focused
    - Are you looking primarily to add value to your life? Or protect against harm? Probably both in varying degrees depending on the context.
8. Small step taker vs Big step taker
    - Taking small steps to build a habit is more sustainable. When change is quick to come, it's quick to go too.
    - On the other hand, if there's a lot of needed/wanted change, taking too much of an "incremental" approach to change can leave you stuck in old patterns too long.

#### Editorial Note

I struggle with these "Types" because my gut says some (or most) of them seem like spectrums more than dichotomies.

For example, very few of us are the epitome of what she calls an "underbuyer", avoiding buying anything when possible, waiting until a couch is ripping at the seams to replace it. And very few of us match her "overbuyer" stereotype, purchasing two pairs of running shoes, a reflective vest, and a book about running when we decide we want to start habitually running.

We're all just more nuanced (and balanced) than that. It seems naive or disingenuous to paint these as dichotomies. Although it seems worthwhile to consider them as spectrums, where one lies on the spectrum, and the impact it has on habit formation.

Personally, I find it extremely difficult to pick a side for both the Familiarity Lover vs Novelty Lover and Promotion- vs Prevention-focused areas.

If I had to choose, I'd call myself a Night Owl, Sprinter, Underbuyer, Simplicity Lover, Finisher, Small Step Taker.
