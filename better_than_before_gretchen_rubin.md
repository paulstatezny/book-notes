# Book Notes: Better Than Before

**Subtitle:** What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits -- To Sleep More, Quit Sugar, Procrastinate Less, and Generally Build a Happier Life

**Author:** Gretchen Rubin

## Observational Strategies

Helping form habits by understanding yourself.

Habits are powerful because they lead you to do things without expending decision-making energy. They make it automatic.

### The Four Tendencies

Centered around whether a person tends to uphold expectations that are **internal** (from oneself) versus **external** (from others).

Most of us fall squarely into one bucket.

1. **Upholder**: Meets inner *and* outer expectations
    - Pro: Very reliable to self, others
    - Con: Often conforms to pointless rules, wasting own time and others' or doing meaningless actions
2. **Questioner**: Resists outer expectations, meets inner expectations
    - Doesn't care about the rules, just what makes sense to them subjectively.
3. **Obliger**: Meets outer expectations, resists inner expectations
    - Really needs to rely on external motivators to solidify a habit. (E.g. Want to read more? Join a book club that has a heavy expectation that everyone will read the material.)
4. **Rebel**: Resists inner *and* outer expectations
    - Basically "what do I feel like doing today"?
    - Helpful to society because they keep its norms in check. (Do these norms make sense?)

### Distinctions

Types of People (Dichotomies)

She basically says you need to engineer habits based on where you fit on a number of different dichotomies.

1. Morning Lark vs Night Owl
2. Marathoner, Sprinter, or Procrastinator
3. Underbuyer vs Overbuyer
4. Simplicity Lover vs Abundance Lover
5. Finisher vs Opener
6. Familiarity Lover vs Novelty Lover
7. Promotion-focused vs Prevention-focused
    - Are you looking primarily to add value to your life? Or protect against harm? Probably both in varying degrees depending on the context.
8. Small step taker vs Big step taker
    - Taking small steps to build a habit is more sustainable. When change is quick to come, it's quick to go too.
    - On the other hand, if there's a lot of needed/wanted change, taking too much of an "incremental" approach to change can leave you stuck in old patterns too long.

#### Self-Questionnaire

- At what time of day do I feel energized? (Morning) When do I drag? (Night)
- Do I like racing from one activity to another, or do I prefer unhurried transitions? (The latter)
- Do I like to listen to experts, or do I prefer to figure things out for myself? (Experts, I think)
- Does spending money on an activity make me feel more committed to it, or less committed? (More)
- Does it bother me to act differently from other people, or do I get a charge out of it? (Bother)
- Am I more likely to indulge in a bad havit in a group, or when I'm alone? (Alone)

#### Editorial Note

I struggle with these "Types" because my gut says some (or most) of them seem like spectrums more than dichotomies.

For example, very few of us are the epitome of what she calls an "underbuyer", avoiding buying anything when possible, waiting until a couch is ripping at the seams to replace it. And very few of us match her "overbuyer" stereotype, purchasing two pairs of running shoes, a reflective vest, and a book about running when we decide we want to start habitually running.

We're all just more nuanced (and balanced) than that. At least, we generally become more balanced as we mature. Thus it seems naive or disingenuous to paint these as dichotomies. Although it seems worthwhile to consider them as spectrums, where one lies on the spectrum, and the impact it has on habit formation.

Personally, I find it extremely difficult to pick a side for both the Familiarity Lover vs Novelty Lover and Promotion- vs Prevention-focused areas.

If I had to choose, I'd call myself a Night Owl, Sprinter, Underbuyer, Simplicity Lover, Finisher, Small Step Taker. (And an Obliger, probably.)

## Pillars of Habits

### Monitoring

We Manage What We Monitor

- It's a saying from business school.
- Monitoring something brings awareness of it, which sparks change.
- Without quantifying our behavior, we typically underestimate or overestimate it.
- Examples: Food tracker, sleep journal, step counter, budgeting app

### First Things First

Start by working on habits that have the biggest impact on your life. Focus on these areas first, in order. It will strengthen self control by protecting us from being physically or mentally taxed. In that way, they become a foundation for other habits.

1. Sleep
    - Stay up until you're tired, and you'll find it harder to get yourself to bed.
    - A lot of people (myself included!) stay up late because they don't schedule time for *themselves*. Go to bed early? No, this is my time to goof off, to spend time with my spouse, etc. I don't want to give my job all of me with nothing left over.
2. Move
    - Exercising more will ironically give you *more* energy.
    - It doesn't need to be formal exercise. Just being *less sedentary* (sitting at a desk all day) makes a huge impact!
    - Form it to you: Are you a lark or owl? Do you enjoy being indoors or outdoors? Are you motivated by competition? Loud music or a quiet background? Would a trainer help motivate you? Do you like challenging yourself with new things (e.g. new skills, pushing yourself), or prefer familiar activities? Do you like sports and games? Is it inconvenient to take a shower afterward?
3. Eat and Drink right
4. Unclutter
    - This is related to the broken window theory. Keeping outer order helps one keep inner order because the precedence is order.
    
## Non-Observational Strategies

### Scheduling

- Putting a habit on the calendar or working it into your routine helps it stick.
- "Quitting Time": pick a time every day after which you don't check email, do any work, or try to accomplish anything productive. (She recommends doing this every day, but letting the specific time be flexible.)
- "Power hour": one hour a week designated for doing all of those small but unpleasant tasks that you've been avoiding. ( although I'm inclined to think of using this for email and snail mail, etc., she doesn't use this time for recurring task like those. Instead, it's one off things that you've been  procrastinating to address.)
- Scheduling can be used to restrict (timebox) tasks so they don't suck up too much time or energy.
- Tip: When you schedule something, force yourself to do that or nothing at all for that time. This helps you not procrastinate.
- "The goal is to develop habits that allow us to have time for everything we value—work, fun, exercise, friends, errands, study—in a way that's sustainable, *forever*. Favoring work at the expense of everything else makes work itself less pleasant, diminishes quality of life, and create a constant feeling of 'emergency'."

### Accountability

- Goes hand in hand with scheduling.
- Especially important for Obligers. (Find creative ways to build accountability systems into your goals.)
- A primary value of personal trainers, nutritionists, etc (beyond their expertise) is the built in accountability.
- Public vs Private Resolvers
  - Public resolvers: Motivated more by going public with their commitments.
  - Private resolvers: Going public tends to sabotage their chances of success.
- The "nuclear option": Hand a friend a stamped envelope with a donation check to an organization you despise, with orders to mail it if you fail. (Works only for time-bound commitments, e.g. no alcohol for 60 days.)

## The Best Time To Begin

### Starting Out

- The best time to begin is always now.
- Is it too daunting to take the first step? Make the first step smaller and smaller until it's not.
- Just as taking the first step has a huge impact, "stops" have a huge impact as well.
    - (Anything that causes you to stop, such as travel, vacation, illness, a new baby, and countless others.)
    - It's important to recognize when a "stop" is happening and make a conscious effort to start again.
    - Ex: Going on vacation for the summer? Instead of "stopping" your yoga class for the summer, schedule your first day back and put it on the calendar so you feel obligated to it.
    - "The fact is, while some habits are almost unbreakable, some habits remain fragile, even after years."
- Re-starting a lapsed habit, or simply continuing a difficult one, can be daunting. In this case, it's helpful to ignore that you want to do the habit indefinitely and simply tell yourself, "this is what I am doing today."
    - "Take that first step, over and over and over."

### The Strategy of the Clean Slate

- We often don't realize, but when change happens in your life new habits will form. We don't pay attention that *that* is the time to try to hijack/program our habits.
-  One doesn't need to wait around for a natural change to happen. One can artificially do something to create this clean slate. ( move around furniture, clean out a room, join a new social group, etc.) 

### The Strategy of the Lightning Bolt

- Sometimes,  instead of building a habit by constant repetition, some big event happens that suddenly and instantly changes us.
- It can be something big like pregnancy or small like a passing comment of a stranger, but it cannot be invoked on command. It happens *to* us.
- Try to recognize when it happens and "ride the wave".

## Desire, Ease, and Excuses

These strategies are about "adjusting the amount of effort involved":

  - Abstaining
  - Convenience
  - Inconvenience
  
These strategies "address the challenges of failure and temptation":

  - Safeguards
  - Loophole-spotting
  - Distraction
  
These strategies "focus on exploiting pleasure to strengthen our good habits":

  - Reward
  - Treats
  - Pairing

"By guarding against excuses and justifications, and by making our habits as enjoyable as possible, we help ourselves succeed."

### The Strategy of Abstaining

- Abstainers vs Moderators
    - Some people are "Abstainers", those who find it much more difficult to do something in moderation (like eat donuts) than to just abstain altogether. (I.e. "Addictive personality"?)
    - For Abstainers, depriving themselves totally is *easier*. It conserves energy and willpower. (Key for habits!) Ironically, 100% abstinence can *feel* less rigid and far more relaxing than trying to maintain a balance of moderation.
    - Moderators do better when they indulge moderately.
    - Abstaining is a bad idea for Moderators; being told (or deciding) they can't have something makes them want it more.
- Could you eat just one square of chocolate a day from a chocolate bar? (Yes? You're a Moderator. No? Abstainer.)
- Most people are Abstainers in some contexts and Moderators in others.
- Tip: Try fasting from various things. After the fast, you can evaluate whether you're happier without them.
- "Research...suggests that the less we indulge in something, the less we want it."

### The Strategies of Convenience and Inconvenience

- Trying to build a habit? Figure out ways to make it convenient.
- Trying to break a bad habit? Figure out ways to make it inconvenient.

### Rewards

- Rewards counterintuitively *harm* our chances of sticking with a habit.
- Why?
    - Rewards lead to conscious decisions; habits are about getting *rid* of the decision (making it automatic)
    - Finish lines (i.e. receiving rewards) offer a *stopping point*, and remember, starting again is difficult. (See "Starting Out")
- Intrinsic motivation is an **extremely** more powerful force for forming habits than extrinsic motivation. (I.e. rewards)
- Intrinsic motivators, from Thomas Malone and Mark Lepper:
    - Challenge
    - Curiosity
    - Control
    - Fantasy
    - Cooperation  (esp. for Obligers)
    - Competition
    - Recognition

### The Strategy of Treats

- Unlike rewards, where you have to "do a good job" to earn it, treats are giving yourself something you want just because you want it.
- Unlike rewards, treats help improve self control.

### The Strategy of Pairing

- "In the Strategy of Pairing, I couple two activities, one that I need or want to do, and one that I don't particularly want to do, to get myself to accomplish them both."

## Author's "Secrets of Adulthood"

- Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
- “What I do every day matters more than what I do once in a while.”
- Things often get harder before they get easier.
- What we assume will be temporary often becomes permanent; what we assume is permanent often proves temporary.
- By giving something up, I gain.

# Applying the book to myself

- Focus first on the Foundation Four (sleep, diet, exercise, and clutter)
- Schedule leisure/bubble time, schedule/timebox coding hours for work, schedule all our needs like processing mail, family time, time to be alone, etc
- Run an experiment to figure out whether I'm a public or private resolver
- Monitor each habit
- Find a way to work social pressure into each habit
- Work a rewards system into habit building — buy something I want after reaching a certain goal toward building a habit
- I'm an Abstainer; watch out for things I should abstain from because I have trouble using moderation.
