## The Four Tendencies

Centered around whether a person tends to uphold expectations that are **internal** (from oneself) versus **external** (from others).

Most of us fall squarely into one bucket.

1. **Upholder**: Meets inner *and* outer expectations
    - Pro: Very reliable to self, others
    - Con: Often conforms to pointless rules, wasting own time and others' or doing meaningless actions
2. **Questioner**: Resists outer expectations, meets inner expectations
    - Pro: Doesn't care about the rules, just what makes sense to them subjectively.
3. **Obliger**: Meets outer expectations, resists inner expectations
    - Really needs to rely on external motivators to solidify a habit. (E.g. Want to read more? Join a book club that has a heavy expectation that everyone will read the material.)
4. **Rebel**: Resists inner *and* outer expectations
    - Basically "what do I feel like doing today"?
    - Helpful to society because they keep its norms in check. (Do these norms make sense?)
