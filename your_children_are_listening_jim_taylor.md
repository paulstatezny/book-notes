## Messages

### Why Messages Matter

- Children are shaped by the messages they receive.
- As parents, we can shape our children by sending them the messages they need to hear.
- The world is full of destructive, unhealthy messages. Children need protection via healthy messages.
- Children will form "defaults" that they fall back on all the time. (Default values, attitudes, and behaviors.) **These defaults are shaped by the messages they receive.**

### What Messages to Send

Survery of 4- to 11-year-olds: What do they want more from their parents?

1. More attention from parents and parents to be more available.
2. More solo time with each parent and to choose what they did with them.
3. Want rules, even though they resist them.
4. Parents to protect and love them in more noticeable ways, so they'd feel safer in a world that feels out of control.
    - E.g. Spontaneous expressions of love, being checked on at night.
5. Did not like being yelled at by parents.
6. Liked "family rituals, routines, and predictability."
